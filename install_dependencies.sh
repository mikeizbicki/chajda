# The Korean language needs the mecab-ko and mecab-ko-dic libraries,
# which unfortunately don't have convenient packaging,
# and must be installed from source.
# These installation instructions are modified from the koNLP project's instructions at:
# https://konlpy.org/en/v0.3.0/install/#optional-installations
#
# NOTE:
# The installation prefix is set to /usr instead of the default /usr/local;
# For some reason, I can't get postgres to load libraries installed in /usr/local,
# but they load just fine in /usr.
# This may interact negatively with an already installed version of mecab,
# and I have not tested this with a system that has both mecab and mecab-ko installed.
